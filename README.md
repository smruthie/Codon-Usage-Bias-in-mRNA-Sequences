# Computing Codon Frequencies in Propionibacterium acidifaciens

I calculated the highest codon frequencies in *Propionibacterium acidifaciens'* complete genome for each amino acid. The initial purpose was to calculate codon frequency for highly expressed genes as they have the most codon bias, but wanted to test it on a complete genome file first. I'm planning to compile a set of highly expressed gene sequences, use this program to compute codon usage frequencies, and confirm if these genes indeed show codon usage bias.
